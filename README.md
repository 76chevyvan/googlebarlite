# Googlebar Lite

Googlebar Lite is an extension for [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) which adds
a Google search toolbar to the browser. It was originally developed as a lightweight replacement for the
[Googlebar](http://googlebar.mozdev.org/) extension, and aspired to replace the most common search functions
provided by the now-defunct official Google Toolbar for Firefox.

Visit the [official Googlebar Lite homepage](http://www.borngeek.com/firefox/googlebarlite/) for more information
and for screenshots of the extension and its available options.
